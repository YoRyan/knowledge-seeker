        <p>Knowledge Seeker is a
        <a href="https://frinkiac.com">Frinkiac</a>-inspired cartoon search
        engine and snapshot and animation creator.</p>

        <h3>How does this work?</h3>
        <p>Episodes were sourced from the <em>Avatar</eM> DVD's, and the closed
        captioning were used to index the dialogue. As such, Knowledge Seeker is
        only aware of what words were said on screen, not individual characters
        or specific concepts. If you want something that understands that, you're
        probably looking for <a href="http://avatar.wikia.com">Avatar Wiki</a>.</p>

        <h3>What are the restrictions on animations?</h3>
        <p>GIF's are limited to 10 seconds, because they grow very large very
        quickly. WEBM's use a modern video format and take up considerably less
        space, so they are limited to 15 seconds.</p>

        <h3>Can I see the internals? (Can I do this for other shows?)</h3>
        <p>Yes, and yes. This web app is powered by <del>magic</del>
        <del>pixelbending</del> Python, Flask, and FFmpeg. It is designed to
        work for all kinds of videos, not just the <em>Avatar</em> series. Source
        code is available on
        <a href="https://github.com/YoRyan/knowledge-seeker">Github</a>.</p>

        <h3>Where did the name come from?</h3>
        <p>The <a href="http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Knowledge_Seekers">foxy
        assistants</a> who collected written works for Wan Shi Tong's library in
        the desert.</p>
