        <h3>How does this work?</h3>
        <p>Episodes were sourced from the Avatar DVD's, and the closed captioning
        were used to index the dialogue. As such, Knowledge Seeker is only aware
        of what words were said on screen, not individual characters or specific
        concepts. If you want something that understands that, you're probably
        looking for <a href="http://avatar.wikia.com">Avatar Wiki</a>.</p>

        <h3>Can I see the internals?</h3>
        <p>Yes. This web app is powered by <del>magic</del>
        <del>pixelbending</del> Python, Flask, and ffmpeg. Source code is available
        on <a href="https://github.com/YoRyan/knowledge-seeker">Github</a>.</p>
